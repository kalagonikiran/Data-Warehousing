GROUPING SETS operator allows us to group data in a number of different ways in a single SELECT statement.

The ROLLUP operator is used to create subtotals and grand totals for a set of columns. The summarized totals are created based on the columns passed to the ROLLUP operator.

The CUBE operator produces subtotals and grand totals. In addition, it produces subtotals and grand totals for every permutation of the columns provided to the CUBE operator.
